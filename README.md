phpBB 3.0.9 on OpenShift
========================

This git repository helps you get up and running quickly w/ a phpBB installation
on OpenShift.  The backend database is MySQL and the database name is the
same as your application name (using $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']).  You can name
your application whatever you want.  However, the name of the database will always
match the application so you might have to update .openshift/action_hooks/build.


Running on OpenShift
--------------------

Create an account at https://www.openshift.com

Create a php application

    rhc app create phpbb php-5.3 mysql-5.1

Add this upstream phpbb repo

    cd phpbb
    git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift-quickstart/phpbb-example.git
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master

    # note: if you named your application something other than 'phpbb' make sure to edit
    #       php/sites/default/settings.php and modify the database to match the name
    #       of your application.

Then push the repo upstream

    git push

That's it, you can now checkout your application at:
    http://phpbb-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com

Default Admin Username: Admin
Default Password: OpenShiftAdmin


Updates
-------

In order to update or upgrade to the latest phpbb, you'll need to re-pull
and re-push.

Pull from upstream:
    cd phpbb/
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
Push the new changes upstream
    git push


Repo layout
-----------

php/ - Externally exposed php code goes here

libs/ - Additional libraries

misc/ - For not-externally exposed php code

../data - For persistent data

.openshift/pear.txt - list of pears to install

.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every push, just prior to starting your app


Notes about layout
------------------

Please leave php, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


pear.txt
-----------

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when
the user git pushes.
